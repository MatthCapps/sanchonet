# Contributing to SanchoNet

Issues and Pull Requests welcome! Basic issues (like typo changes for example) should be
done via a PR fixing it rather than opening an issue asking someone to fix it.

We intend the website to be community-led, fun and exciting. The more
people we get contributing, the better it will be.

Welcome to the island of Barataria!!!

## Pull Request Process

1. Test changes locally with docusaurus.
2. Submit PR.
3. PR can be merged with one review.
4. Website auto-deploys after merging
