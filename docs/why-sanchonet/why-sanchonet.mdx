title: 'Why SanchoNet?'
---

The naming of "SanchoNet" is inspired by the rich and multifaceted character of Sancho Panza. In the story, Sancho evolves from a simple farmer into a wise governor 
and a loyal friend, embodying virtues that resonate with the principles guiding the development and governance of this network.

Sancho's growth throughout the novel represents a synthesis of realism and idealism. He starts with a practical, down-to-earth perspective but gradually appreciates and 
even embraces the nobility in Don Quixote's vision of chivalry. His transformation culminates in the episode of governing the fictional "Island of Barataria," where his innate 
wisdom and common sense guide him in delivering just and wise judgments.

Sancho's ability to balance pragmatic realities with lofty ideals mirrors the essence of SanchoNet. Like Sancho, we strive to foster a system that is rooted in reality 
yet guided by visionary principles. It aims to create a platform where anyone has a voice that will be heard, embracing inclusiveness and practical wisdom in governance.

The choice of "SanchoNet" also reflects the character's transformative journey, echoing the broader themes of growth, self-assurance, and integrity that run throughout 
"Don Quixote." The alignment of Sancho with the chivalric code, his self-realization, and the courage to embrace the extraordinary within himself symbolize the Cardano's 
aspiration to innovate, empower people, and achieve greatness.

Furthermore, the close relationship between Don Quixote and Sancho, marked by friendship, mutual influence, and a complex balance between dreams and reality, mirrors the
collaborative spirit that SanchoNet seeks to foster within the Cardano community. It's a partnership that transcends mere transactional interactions and evolves into a shared 
journey towards a better, fair, and visionary ecosystem.
