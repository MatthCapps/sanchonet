# Stake pool operators (SPOs)

Stake pool operators play a crucial role as they are responsible for creating blocks and maintaining the network. On Sanchonet, their importance extends beyond these functions. During the initial phases of Sanchonet, SPOs take on an even more pivotal role as they are the only participants with the ability to vote on governance actions. This arrangement will persist  until the functionalities for delegate representative (DRep) registration, delegation, and voting are introduced.
