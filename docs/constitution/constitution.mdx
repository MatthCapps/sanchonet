We are thrilled to announce the upcoming **Sancho Constitutional Convention**, where we will gather together to collectively draft the inaugural Constitution for Barataria.

This historic event aims to unite our community as we embark on the journey of crafting a robust and inclusive Constitution that will serve as the foundation for Barataria's governance and principles.
The Convention will provide a platform for diverse voices to be heard, fostering a collaborative environment to ensure that every member's perspective and vision are reflected in the final document.

By participating in the Sancho Constitutional Convention, you have the unique opportunity to shape the future of Barataria and contribute to its development as a thriving, decentralized community. We believe that a
Constitution created collectively will embody the values and aspirations of each individual, fostering a sense of ownership and responsibility among all stakeholders.

**Stay tuned for further updates on the Convention's schedule, agenda, and participation guidelines.** Together, let's build a Constitution that empowers and unites us as we forge
a path for Barataria's future. Your presence and active engagement in this momentous event will be instrumental in shaping the destiny of our community.

*NOTE* that all rules in the constitution should be fictitious and not relate to actual rules on the blockchain. This activity is not intended to develop
a constitution for Cardano, but rather to have fun writing one specifically for Barataria. Quotes directly from Don Quixote welcome, but also
rules in a similar vein that aren't directly from the book are acceptable.
