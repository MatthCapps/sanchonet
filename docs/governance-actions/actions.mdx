| 1. Motion of no-confidence                                          | A motion to create a _state of no-confidence_ in the current constitutional committee |
| 2. New constitutional committee and/or threshold and/or term limits | Changes to the members of the constitutional committee and/or to its signature threshold and/or term limits|
| 3. Updates to the Constitution                                      | A modification to the off-chain Constitution, recorded as an on-chain hash of the text document |
| 4. Hard-Fork[^2] Initiation                                         | Triggers a non-backwards compatible upgrade of the network; requires a prior software upgrade |
| 5. Protocol Parameter Changes                                       | Any change to **one or more** updatable protocol parameters, excluding changes to major protocol versions ("hard forks") |
| 6. Treasury Withdrawals                                             | Movements from the treasury, sub-categorized into small, medium or large withdrawals (based on the amount of Lovelace to be withdrawn). The thresholds for treasury withdrawals are discussed below. |
| 7. Info                                                             | An action that has no effect on-chain, other than an on-chain record. |

The abilty to propose the different types of governance actions will be released in phases during the lifespan of SanchoNet. For example:

* In **Phase 1** we can propose **Updates to the Constitution** 
* **Phase 2** will incorporate ability to propose **Info** governance actions
* **Phase 3** and subsequent will bring further capabilities.
