The ability to propose various types of governance actions will be released in phases during the lifespan of SanchoNet. For example:

* **Phase 1** will allow proposing **updates to the constitution** 
* **Phase 2** will incorporate the ability to propose **Info** governance actions
* **Phase 3** and subsequent phases will bring further capabilities.
