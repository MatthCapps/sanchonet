The upcoming **Sancho constitutional convention** will gather participants to collaboratively draft the inaugural constitution for Barataria.

This historic event aims to unite the community embarking on the journey of crafting a strong and inclusive constitution that will establish the bedrock of Barataria's governance and principles. The convention will provide a platform for diverse voices to be heard, fostering a collaborative environment to ensure that every member's perspective and vision are reflected in the final document.

By participating in the Sancho constitutional convention, you'll get the unique opportunity to shape the future of Barataria and contribute to its growth as a thriving, decentralized community. The collectively formed constitution will embody the values and aspirations of each individual, facilitating a sense of ownership and responsibility among all stakeholders.

**Stay tuned for further updates on the convention's schedule, agenda, and participation guidelines.** Your presence and active engagement in this momentous event will be instrumental in shaping the destiny of the community.

*NOTE* that all rules outlined in the constitution should be fictional and unrelated to the actual rules on the blockchain. This activity is not meant to construct a constitution for Cardano; rather, it's a fun exercise in creating one tailored for Barataria. Quotes directly from Don Quixote are encouraged, as well as rules in a similar spirit that aren't directly extracted from the book.
