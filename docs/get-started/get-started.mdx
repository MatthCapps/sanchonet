# SanchoNet

Welcome to SanchoNet - your gateway to Cardano's governance future!

SanchoNet is the testnet for rolling out groundbreaking governance features for the Cardano blockchain, aligning with the comprehensive CIP-1694 specifications. SanchoNet stands apart from other testnets; it's a vibrant, inclusive, and community-driven platform. Every community member is invited to join SanchoNet and actively contribute to shaping Cardano's governance future.

As SanchoNet advances in its journey of implementation and feature rollout, the community is encouraged to embrace specific roles crucial for testing and refining the governance mechanisms:

1. **Test-ada holders**:
As a test-ada holder, your role is paramount. You can engage in crafting and submitting governance actions, and your insights will be invaluable to ensure that the governance system upholds the highest standards of security and efficiency.

2. **Stake pool operators** (SPOs):
SPOs are the backbone of any blockchain network, and on SanchoNet, it's no different. As an SPO, you can take charge and run the testnet network with diligence and integrity. Your ability to vote on relevant governance actions will significantly impact the direction of Cardano's governance evolution.

3. **Delegate representatives** (DReps):
DReps are the voice of the broader community. As a representative, your role involves participating in voting on governance actions. You can consider the collective interests of the Cardano community as you engage in these important decisions.

4. **Constitutional committee**:
The constitutional committee holds the responsibility of ensuring that the governance process remains fair, transparent, and aligned with the best interests of the community and Cardano's constitution. As a member of this committee, you will play a vital role in upholding the values that contribute to Cardano's thriving ecosystem.

SanchoNet is more than just a testnet, it is a playground of opportunities. Within this space, the community can collaboratively create a governance system that is robust, decentralized, and truly community-driven. Your involvement, dedication, and passion will be the driving force behind SanchoNet's success.
