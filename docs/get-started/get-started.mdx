Welcome to Sanchonet - your gateway to Cardano's governance future

We are excited to introduce you to Sanchonet, the testnet where we are set to roll out groundbreaking governance features for the Cardano blockchain, aligning with the comprehensive CIP-1694 specifications. This marks a pivotal milestone in Cardano's evolution, and we are thrilled to have you on board!

Sanchonet stands apart from other testnets; it's a vibrant, inclusive, and community-driven platform. Here, you'll have the perfect opportunity to intimately familiarize yourself with the revolutionary governance system outlined in CIP-1694. Every community member is invited to join Sanchonet and actively contribute to shaping Cardano's governance future.

As we progress in this journey of implementation and feature rollout, we encourage you to take on specific roles critical for testing and refining the governance mechanisms:

1. **Test-ada holders**:
As a test-ada holder, your role is paramount. We encourage you to engage actively in crafting and submitting governance actions. Your insights and feedback are invaluable to ensure that the governance system upholds the highest standards of security and efficiency.

2. **Stake pool operators**:
Stake pool operators (SPOs) are the backbone of any blockchain network, and on Sanchonet, it's no different. We call upon you to take charge and run the testnet network with diligence and integrity. Your ability to vote on relevant governance actions will significantly impact the direction of Cardano's governance evolution.

3. **Delegate representatives**:
Delegate representatives (DReps) are the voice of the broader community. As a representative, your role involves participating in voting on governance actions. We urge you to consider the collective interests of the Cardano community as you engage in these important decisions.

4. **Constitutional committee**:
The constitutional committee holds the responsibility of ensuring that the governance process remains fair, transparent, and aligned with the best interests of the community and Cardano's constitution. As a member of this committee, you will play a vital role in upholding the values that contribute to Cardano's thriving ecosystem.

Sanchonet is more than just a testnet, it is a playground of opportunities. Here, you can actively contribute to shaping the future of Cardano's governance and be part of a momentous shift in the blockchain landscape.

Together, we will create a governance system that is robust, decentralized, and truly community-driven. Your involvement, dedication, and passion will be the driving force behind Sunchonet's success.

Join us on this transformative journey! Let's embrace the challenges, learn together, and pave the way for the Cardano governance system.

Welcome to Sanchonet - where Cardano's governance future begins!
