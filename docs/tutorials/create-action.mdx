Currently,  (Phase1) only stake pools can **create** and **vote** governance actions. In upcomming releases we will incorporate 
te ability for any ada-holder to submit governance actions. This means that, at the moment, the best way to create governance actions on SanchoNet is to become a [Sancho Stake Pool Operator](../roles/spo.mdx). 
Once you have your pool running it is a very simple process to create an action:

1. Write a constitution update and save it to a text file

```
echo "We are cardano and we are going to change the world!" > constitution.txt
```
2. You can check the hash of the constitution.txt file with 
```
b2sum -l 256 constitution.txt
```
you should see:
```
df452c58fdbc203d78188f94d067d63df87891d9dba43f32b953b8ea5a959a69  constitution.txt
```
* The Cardano-CLI might at some point provide a functionality for hashing action files.
  
3. Create the action file

```
cardano-cli governance action create-action create-constitution \
  --conway-era \
  --governance-action-deposit 1000000 \
  --cold-verification-key-file cold.vkey \
  --constitution-file constitution.txt \
  --out-file constitution.action
```
4. If all went well you should be able to see the constitution.action content
```
cat constitution.action
```

5. Now, let's build a transaction with the proposal

```
  cardano-cli transaction build --testnet-magic 4 --conway-era \
  --tx-in $(cardano-cli query utxo --address $(cat payment.addr) --testnet-magic 4 --out-file /dev/stdout | jq -r 'keys[0]') \
  --change-address $(cat payment.addr) \
  --constitution-file constitution.action \
  --witness-override 2 \
  --out-file tx.raw
```
6. Sign it with the SPO cold.skey and a payment.skey
```
cardano-cli transaction sign \
  --tx-body-file tx.raw \
  --signing-key-file cold.skey \
  --signing-key-file payment.skey \
  --testnet-magic 4 \
  --out-file tx.signed
```
7. And submit it to the chain 
```
cardano-cli transaction submit \
  --testnet-magic 4 \
  --tx-file tx.signed
```

**And with that, you have submitted a Constitution update governance action!** 


8. Now, we will need the Action Id so that we can share it with people on **Discord** and try to get their support on our action. For now, the easiest way to get it is to query our balance again. 
The UTXO and Index that we created is the Action Id

```
cardano-cli query utxo --address $(cat payment.addr) --testnet-magic 4 --out-file /dev/stdout | jq -r 'keys[0]'
```
You should get something like this: 

```
64e7cad9b3ece7451c5b12043bdcdaa3c563392fa97eb9f2cec02fe821dffa54#0
```
